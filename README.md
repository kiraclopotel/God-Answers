## Philosophy

**What You Need vs What You Want:**
You may ask about one thing but receive guidance about another. God doesn't always answer the question you *think* you're asking—He answers the question your *soul* is truly asking.

**Interpretation:**
Sacred texts speak in metaphor and timeless truth. Your task is to meditate on how the passage relates to your situation, feel what stirs in your heart, and apply the wisdom in a positive way.

**Daily Limits:**
Divine guidance is sacred, not casual. Each seeking should be intentional. Quality over quantity.
